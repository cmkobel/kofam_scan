# This is a file to declare which gems (libraries) to install and use.
#
# Since this file contains no gems required to run the tool so far,
# you will not need to install gems if you are just a user.
# You will need these gems only on developing/testing the tool.
#
# You can install gems listed below by this command:
#   $ gem install bundler
#   $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
# If it is not your first time to execute this command, then you can just run
#   $ bundle install
